    <h1>{% trans "Our Team's Goal" %}</h1>

    <p>{% trans "As an F1 in Schools team, we combine engineering passion with methodical planning. Our first priority is mastering aerodynamics—we analyze airflow patterns through simulations and wind tunnel testing to optimize every surface of our car. This knowledge directly informs the construction of our functional chassis, where we balance lightweight design with structural integrity using CAD and precision manufacturing.Beyond technical excellence, we set measurable targets: achieving optimal aerodynamic efficiency, competitive race times, and strict budget adherence. Equally important is building a legacy; we're documenting every step to ensure future teams can continue and improve our work. Competing in the national finals represents both our ambition and an opportunity to test our limits. Finally, none of this would be possible without the strong collaboration between team members, teachers, and our school's support—this partnership is what transforms sketches into race-ready cars." %}</p>
